	O (1) The running time of a constant-time algorithm does not depend on the
	input size. A typical constant-time algorithm is a direct formula that
	calculates the answer.

	O (log n ) A logarithmic algorithm often halves the input size at each step. The
	running time of such an algorithm is logarithmic, because log 2 n equals the
	number of times n must be divided by 2 to get 1.

	O ( n ) A linear algorithm goes through the input a constant number of times. This
	is often the best possible time complexity, because it is usually necessary to
	access each input element at least once before reporting the answer.

	O ( n log n ) This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm sorts the input,
	because the time complexity of efficient sorting algorithms is O ( n log n ).
	Another possibility is that the algorithm uses a data structure where each
	operation takes O (log n ) time.
